# Scripts for PowerDNS Split-DNS and Malware Filtering

This script-set was created to facilitate Malware Filtering and Split-DNS support on
PowerDNS Recursor Services.

You may include DNSBLs and IPBLs with different formats such as Adblock, REGEX, Wildcard or
Plain Domain Lists (hosts format is excluded as that is supported by default
by PowerDNS Recursor).

It's especially useful in cases where you might have a Reverse Proxy as a sort of *Gateway*
that handles all your web services, or cases where you might need to replace Internal DNS
Zone Records through REGEX Patterns.

Script Repository maintained by Dylan Blanqu√©. Created January 2024.

# REQUIREMENTS

You must have `lua-rex-pcre` or `lua-rex-pcre2` installed (Can be done with `apt` or `luarocks`).

E.g.:
```bash
apt update -y
apt install lua-rex-pcre -y || apt install lua-rex-pcre2 -y
```

# INSTRUCTIONS

To use this script-set, after you've ensured the requirements are met you can
clone this repository with `git` onto your `/etc/powerdns` directory and add
or modify the following line in your PowerDNS Recursor Configuration File:

```bash
cd /etc/powerdns
git clone https://github.com/dblanque/pdns-recursor-scripts
```

```conf
# /etc/powerdns/recursor.conf
lua-dns-script=/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/hooks.lua
```

## Local Domain Overriding

For Split DNS (and to reduce the usage of NAT Reflection) you may use the following
options in the `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/overrides.lua` file.

Bear in mind you must also configure your internal domains in the `local-domains.list`
file for this feature to work properly.

You can override NS Servers for your local zones, as well as standard record types
such as CNAME, A, and AAAA, for example.

```lua
local options_overrides = {
        internal_reverse_proxy_v4 = "YOUR_INTERNAL_WEB_REVERSE_PROXY",
        internal_reverse_proxy_v6 = "YOUR_INTERNAL_WEB_REVERSE_PROXY",
        use_local_forwarder = true,
        private_zones_ns_override_map_only = true,
        private_zones_ns_override_map = {
                ['domain.com'] = {'ns1','ns2','dns','dot','doh'}
        },
        private_zones_ns_override = true,
        override_map = {
                ['something.domain.com']={
                        "A",
                        {"127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.2"}
                }
        },
        regex_map = {
                ['^(mail|smtp|imap|smtps|smtp)\\..*$']={
                        "CNAME",
                        {"mailserver.domain.com"}
                },
                ['^(dns|dot|doh|ns[0-9])\\..*$']={
                        "A",
                        {"127.0.0.1"}
                }
        },
        default_ttl = 900
}
return options_overrides
```

## Malware Filtering

For Blocklists and some Malware Filtering DNS you may use the following
options in the `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/overrides.lua`.

```lua
local options_overrides = {
	use_dnsbl = true, -- If you want to DNSBL files (.list|.txt) in the dnsbl.d directory
	use_ipbl = true -- If you want IPBL files (.list|.txt) in the ipbl.d directory
}
return options_overrides
```
