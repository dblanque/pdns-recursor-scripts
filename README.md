# Scripts for PowerDNS Split-DNS and Malware Filtering

This script-set was created to facilitate Malware Filtering and Split-DNS support on
PowerDNS Recursor Services.

You may include DNSBLs and IPBLs with different formats such as Adblock, REGEX, Wildcard or
Plain Domain Lists (hosts format is excluded as that is supported by default
by PowerDNS Recursor).

It's especially useful in cases where you might have a Reverse Proxy as a sort of *Gateway*
that handles all your web services, or cases where you might need to replace Internal DNS
Zone Records through REGEX Patterns.

Script Repository maintained by Dylan Blanqu√©. Created January 2024.

# REQUIREMENTS

You must have `lua-rex-pcre` or `lua-rex-pcre2` installed (Can be done with
`apt` or `luarocks`).

E.g.:
```bash
apt update -y
apt install lua-rex-pcre -y || apt install lua-rex-pcre2 -y
```

You must have the `dig` command installed as well, for full cname chain
resolution on local domain overrides.

```
apt update -y
apt install dnsutils
```

# INSTRUCTIONS

To use this script-set, after you've ensured the requirements are met you can
clone this repository with `git` onto your `/etc/powerdns` directory and add
or modify the following line in your PowerDNS Recursor Configuration File:

```bash
cd /etc/powerdns
git clone https://github.com/dblanque/pdns-recursor-scripts
```

```conf
# /etc/powerdns/recursor.conf (Legacy)
lua-dns-script=/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/hooks.lua
```

```yaml
# /etc/powerdns/recursor.conf (YAML)
recursor:
  lua_dns_script: /etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/hooks.lua
```

## Local Domain Overriding (For Split-DNS)

For Split DNS (and to reduce the usage of NAT Reflection) you may use the
following options in the following files:
* `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/settings.lua`
* `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/local-resolve.lua`

Bear in mind you must also configure your internal domains in the `local-domains.list`
file for this feature to work properly `(See local-domains-example.list)`.

You can override NS Servers for your local zones, as well as standard record types
such as CNAME, A, and AAAA, for example.

Generally speaking the application is for when you want to let your internal
main domain be resolved by your Domain Controller (e.g. Samba LDAP,
Microsoft ADDS, etc.), but you also want other internal domains to resolve to
your internal reverse proxy without having to manually administrate each zone.

For that end you may put all your internal domains except for your main domain
in the `local-domains.list` file, and define your main domain as `main_domain`
(For alternative functions like `postresolve_binat` to work).

### DISCLAIMER

CNAME internal domain replacement does not support full CNAME chain resolution
so you may need to use A/AAAA records if your application does not complete
the DNS chain by itself.

```lua
-- /etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/local-resolve.lua
-- Beware, this file gets directly included into the hooks.lua file
-- You can load multiple config files, repeated options will be replaced by the last file.
-- Recommended names: overrides.lua || settings.lua || conf_dnsbl.lua || conf_local.lua
return {
	-- Local Domain Override Options
	main_domain = "example.com",
	use_one_to_one = false,
    one_to_one_subnets = {
        ["127.0.0.0/16"]={
			["target"]="100.65.1.0/16",
			["acl"]={
				"100.64.0.0/16",
			}
		}
    },
	internal_reverse_proxy_v4 = "YOUR_INTERNAL_WEB_REVERSE_PROXY",
	internal_reverse_proxy_v6 = "YOUR_INTERNAL_WEB_REVERSE_PROXY",
	use_local_forwarder = false,
	exclude_main_domain_from_irp = true,
	exclude_local_forwarder_domains = {
		"external.example.com"
	},
	exclude_local_forwarder_domains_re = {
		"^(sub1|sub2).example.com$"
	},
	override_map = {
		["something.example.com"]={
			qtype="A",
			content={"127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.2"}
		}
	},
	regex_map = {
		["^(mail|smtp|imap|smtps|smtp)\\..*$"]={
			qtype="CNAME",
			content={"mailserver.example.com"},
		},
		["^(dns|dot|doh|ns[0-9])\\..*$"]={
			qtype="A",
			content={"127.0.0.1"},
		}
	},
	default_ttl = 900,

	-- Malware Filter Options
	use_dnsbl = false, -- If you want to preresolve with DNSBL files (.list|.txt) in the dnsbl.d directory
	use_ipbl = false, -- If you want to postresolve with IPBL files (.list|.txt) in the ipbl.d directory
}
```

## Blocklist Filtering

For Blocklists and some Malware Filtering DNS you may use the following
options in the `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/malware-filter.lua`.

### Supported Syntaxes
* Adblock: ||example.com^
* PCRE: Assumed if matches special regex chars and not Adblock Syntax
* HOSTS: Entries starting with the following IPs will be ingested/blocked
  * 0.0.0.0
  * 127.0.0.1
  * ::
  * 2001:1::1
* Standard: A normal TXT Domain list.

### Whitelist

To whitelist domains create a `/etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/dnsbl_whitelist.txt`
file with one domain per line.

```lua
-- /etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/conf.d/malware-filter.lua
return {
	use_dnsbl = true, -- If you want to preresolve with DNSBL files (.list|.txt|.hosts) in the dnsbl.d directory
	use_ipbl = true, -- If you want to postresolve with IPBL files (.list|.txt|.hosts) in the ipbl.d directory
}
```

# RE-LOADING DNSBL/IPBL

To reload the lists all you need to do is execute the following command:

`rec_control reload-lua-script`
OR
`rec_control reload-lua-script /etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/hooks.lua`

You may also add this onto a cronjob with the following format to reload every day at 00:00.

```cron
00 00   * * *   root    rec_control reload-lua-script /etc/powerdns/pdns-recursor-scripts/hooks.lua 2&>1 /dev/null
```
